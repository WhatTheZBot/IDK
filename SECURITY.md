# Security Protocol

## Reporting a Vulnerability

I take security issues seriously and appreciate responsible disclosure.

If you believe you have found a security vulnerability, **please do not report it in a public GitHub issue**.

Instead, use one of the following private channels:

- Open a **GitHub Security Advisory** 
- Or contact the maintainers directly if a private email is listed

OR

- Please report it via: [My Email](mrniftyfireofficial@outlook.com)

Please include:
- A clear description of the issue
- Steps to reproduce (if applicable)
- Potential impact
- Any relevant proof-of-concept or logs

We will acknowledge receipt and work to assess the issue as quickly as possible.
